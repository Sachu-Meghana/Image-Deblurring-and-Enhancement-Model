# Image-Deblurring-and-Enhancement-Model
Built a two-stage image restoration system using LAB-based Wiener filtering for deblurring and Real-ESRGAN for 4Ã— resolution enhancement. Enhanced clarity with adaptive sharpening and CLAHE, delivering sharp, high-resolution outputs from blurred, low-res inputs.
